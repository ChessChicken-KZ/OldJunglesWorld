## Setup

There is no Fabric-API for beta 1.7.3, so this mod uses [StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI).

## Current features
- [X] Jewelry api (must be polished).
- [X] Hunger api.
- [X] Golden Chicken and Egg.
- [X] Eldritch (just analog of a book, but on single paper).

Please note, that this mod can be refactored in the future, due to StationAPI itself is updating.
